					<p class="quote">Daniel joined ActionIQ in summer 2017 as a member of the fullstack engineering team and has already made invaluable contributions to our team and company. He is incredibly skilled at adapting to new languages and frameworks picking up Scala, Thrift, TypeScript, and many others during his first few months here -- most on his own. In the case of TypeScript, he convinced the team to adopt it as our primary frontend language. We treat all new engineer hires at ActionIQ, no matter the level, as technical leaders and owners and Daniel proved to us that we should continue that mentality. Early on, Daniel was given a large production project to own. His code is clean, thought out, and well crafted. He was a reliable leader for the project, communicating well with both the product and the UX teams as requirements changed and timelines needed to be adjusted. Overall, Daniel is a tremendous addition to the team, is a great engineer, and I'm very excited to see what he has in store for the future!</p>

					<p class="quote">Daniel and I worked together on a number of website projects over the last two years. Daniel is sharp and has been a quick study, acclimating to a diverse set of web technologies and frameworks with apparent ease. Among other positive qualities, Daniel is adaptive, communicative, dependable, and has the ability to quickly educate himself where needed. It was a pleasure working with him.</p>
